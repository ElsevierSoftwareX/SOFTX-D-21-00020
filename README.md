Quail is a lightweight, open-source discontinuous Galerkin code written in Python for teaching and prototyping. Currently, Quail solves first-order nonlinear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations.


### Setup
Python 3.7 or higher is required. The following libraries should also be installed (tested version number provided):
  - NumPy 1.17.4
  - Matplotlib 3.3.1
  - SciPy 1.4.1

For convenience, the Quail root directory (where this file is located) can be added to PATH.
```sh
$ export PATH=$PATH:/your/quail/directory
```
The above line can also be added to the appropriate file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.profile`) and sourced.


### Using Quail 
A suite of example 1D and 2D cases for scalar equations and the compressible Euler equations is available in the `examples` directory. For instance, to run the 2D isentropic vortex case, do the following:
```sh
$ cd examples/euler/2D/isentropic_vortex/
$ quail isentropic_vortex.py
```

Additional tools for performing dissipation and dispersion analysis and plotting basis functions are available in the `tools` directory. To perform said analysis, do the following:
```sh
$ cd tools/dissipation_dispersion_analysis/
$ python plot_dissipation_dispersion_relations.py 
```
Settings can be changed directly in `plot_dissipation_dispersion_relations.py`.
To plot 1D basis functions, do the following:
```sh
$ cd tools/plot_basis_functions/
$ python plot_segment_basis_fcn.py  
```
Settings can be changed directly in `plot_segment_basis_fcn.py`. Basis functions for triangles and quadrilaterals can also be plotted.


### Additional information
Additional details on Quail and the discontinuous Galerkin method can be found in the included documentation (`docs/documentation.pdf`). Please submit issues and questions on the github page.
