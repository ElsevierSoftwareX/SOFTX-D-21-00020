This case involves 2D constant advection of a Gaussian pulse.
  - Periodic boundaries in the x- and y-directions
  - 10th order modal basis on uniform triangular elements
  - Post-processing
    - Scalar contour with mesh and element IDs displayed
  - After running a simulation, create an animation with the command below. An MP4 file can be saved if the appropriate tools for processing video files are installed (e.g., FFmpeg).

```sh
$ quail -p create_anim.py
```
