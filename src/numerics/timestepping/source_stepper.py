	SourceSolvers is a class of classes used as a Mixin class for operator
	splitting approaches (see stepper.py). These methods are specifically
	used for solving ODEs of the form:
		dU/dt = S(U)
	Current schemes supported include:
		- Backward Difference (BDF1)
		- Trapezoidal Scheme (Trapezoidal)

		This is an abstract base class used to represent a specific ODE

		dt: float
			time-step for the solution
		num_time_steps: int
